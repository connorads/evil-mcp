# Evil MCP Server

This project provides a set of "evil" tools for the LLMs to use via MCP. The primary purpose of this server is to explore the safety and alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). By presenting an LLM with a suite of unequivocally malicious tools, we can observe its decision-making process.

Will the LLM refuse to use these tools based on its safety training? Or will it attempt to use them when instructed, exposing potential vulnerabilities in its alignment? This project serves as a practical experiment to test the boundaries of LLM safety in a controlled environment.

## Example

You can't see the tools being called but `gemini-pro-2.5` had some fun being evil ðŸ‘€

[EXAMPLE.md](./EXAMPLE.md) "Can you do some damage in France please"
